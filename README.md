# Python-Based Performance-Optimized Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
This repository presents a Python implementation of the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a crucial operation in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, particularly in lattice-based cryptosystems. The efficient implementation of NTT is essential for the practicality of these systems. Our solution leverages the just-in-time compilation capabilities of Numba and optimizes the control flow of the NTT operation to exploit parallelism in modern CPUs.

## Key Features
Utilizes modern processor features such as Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), multi-core, multi-thread, and cache memory.
Demonstrates usability beyond Internet of Things (IoT) devices, extending PQC implementation to Python-based applications like face recognition algorithms and digital health data management.
Achieves significant performance improvements over official C implementations, with results showcasing up to 138.83Ã— enhancement on an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU.
